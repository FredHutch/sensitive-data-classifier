Realistic Medical Document Templates

These templates create documents that closely approximate real medical records
for benchmarking PHI classification systems. PHI is embedded naturally in
clinical narrative rather than structured lists.

Key characteristics:
- 20-50 PHI identifiers per document (realistic density)
- Narrative clinical notes style
- Natural embedding of identifiers in context
- Varied document types with appropriate content
- Mimics actual EHR/medical record output
